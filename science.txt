Abstract: To improve the flow of quality information and combat fake news on social media, it is essential to identify the origins and evolution patterns of false information. However, scholarship dedicated to this area is lacking. Using a recent development in the field of computational network science (i.e., evolution tree analysis), this study examined this issue in the context of the 2016 US presidential election. By retrieving 307,738 tweets about 30 fake and 30 real news stories, we examined the root content, producers of original source, and evolution patterns. The findings revealed that root tweets about fake news were mostly generated by accounts from ordinary users, but they often included a link to non-credible news websites. Additionally, we observed significant differences between real and fake news stories in terms of evolution patterns. In our evolution tree analysis, tweets about real news showed wider breadth and shorter depth than tweets about fake news. The results also indicated that tweets about real news spread widely and quickly, but tweets about fake news underwent a greater number of modifications in content over the spreading process.

Abstract: Objectives
Fake news: misinformation and falsehood of health news in social media constitute a potential threat to the public health, but the scope of this issue remains unclear. Our pilot study is an initial attempt to measure a number of the top shared health misinformation stories in the Polish language social media.
Methods
Using the BuzzSumo Application, a range of the top shared health web links in the Polish language social media was assessed during the period between 2012 and 2017. We used the following keywords which were related to the most common diseases and causes of death: cancer, neoplasm, heart attack, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, vaccinations, HIV, and AIDS. Each link was checked for the presence of fake news.
Results
40% of the most frequently shared links contained text we classified as fake news. These were shared more than 450,000 times. The most fallacious content concerned vaccines, while news about cardiovascular diseases was, in general, well sourced and informative. More than 20% of dangerous links from our material was generated by one source.
Conclusions
Analyzing social media top shared news could contribute to identification of leading fake medical information miseducating the society. It might also encourage authorities to take actions such as put warnings on biased domains or scientifically evaluate those generating fake health news.

Abstract: This study examined situational, psychological, and neurobiological factors associated with deceptive behavior in 8-year-old children. By assessing deception in low- and high-risk conditions, we differentiated between children displaying some dishonesty and children who deceived repeatedly, and we assessed the correlates of deception in 163 children. A large majority of the children were deceptive in the low-risk condition (n=121, 74.2%), but most children refrained from deception when at risk for getting caught (69 of 121). Using an aggregate score, children who continued deceiving could be discriminated from other children based on gender, lower age, lower IQ, less effortful control, and lower educated mothers. Compared with honest children and high-risk deceivers, low-risk deceivers differed on an aggregate score, suggesting that they were more likely to be girls and to come from higher income families. Compared with the other children, high-risk deceivers showed decreased activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and right frontal pole during the low-risk condition, suggesting decreased engagement in conflict monitoring and error detection during opportunities for deception. In high-risk deceivers, high-risk deception was associated with increased bilateral ACC and right paracingulate gyrus activation compared with low-risk deception. High-risk deceivers may require a higher level of risk to engage the ACC to the same degree as low-risk deceivers or honest children. Our results suggest that deceptive behavior in children seems to be largely dependent on the estimated likelihood of getting caught. High-risk deceivers form a distinct group with different cognitive and neurobiological characteristics compared with honest children and low-risk deceivers.

Abstract: For there are always several kinds of rumors spreading simultaneously in real networks, the research about multiple rumors propagation process is necessary and significant. In this paper, considering the spread of two rumors with different launch time, and assuming the content of each rumor may have nothing to do with the others, we study the double-rumors concurrently spreading dynamics in complex networks, and introduce two kinds of double-rumors spreading models: the DSIR model and the C-DSIR model. We then provide the double-rumors dissemination mechanism by states-vectors expressions and derive the mean-field equations of models to describe their dynamics. Particularly, without rumors priorities, we introduce a selection parameter θ for spreaders to express the attractions of different rumors, and study the influence of this parameter on double-rumors spreading. Numerical simulations are performed to explore the interaction between two rumors, and we investigate the spreading peak and the final size of the rumors with various parameters. Simulation results indicate that, the best launch time of new rumor exists explicitly for the DSIR model, the selection parameter θ and the delay time Tin are interdependent quantities, and the closer the start time of new rumor is to the best time, the more obvious the interdependence would be. Meanwhile, Tin is also a network-dependent parameter for our models in a series of BA networks. Furthermore, under the same conditions, the influential nodes identified by large coreness are the relative better promulgators for new rumor, so they are what the strategy should give priorities to. Our experiment reveals some interesting patterns of double-rumors spreading and suggest a possible avenue for further study of interplays of multiple pieces of information in complex network.

Abstract: Biomedical engineering research trend can be healthcare models with unobtrusive smart systems for monitoring vital signs and physical activity. Detecting infant facial cry because of inability to communicate pain, recognizing facial emotion to understand dysfunction mechanisms through micro expression or transform captured human expression with motion device into three-dimensional objects are some of the applied systems. Nowadays, collaborated with biomedical research, mining and analyzing social network can improve public and private health care sectors as well such as research health news shared on social media about pharmaceutical drugs, pandemics, or viral outbreaks. Due to the vast amount of shared news, there is an urgency to select and filter information to prevent the spread of hoax or fake news. We explored in depth some steps to classify hoaxes written as news articles. This discussion also encourages on how technologies of social network analysis could be used to make new kinds improvement in health care sectors. Then close with a description of limitless future possibilities of biomedical engineering research in social media.

Abstract: Rumor spreading has a profound influence on people’s well-being and social stability. There are many factors influencing rumor spreading. In this paper, we recommended an assumption that among the common mass there are three attitudes towards rumors: to like rumor spreading, to dislike rumor spreading, and to be hesitant (or neutral) to rumor spreading. Based on such an assumption, a Susceptible–Hesitating–Affected–Resistant(SHAR) model is established, which considered individuals’ different attitudes towards rumor spreading. We also analyzed the local and global stability of rumor-free equilibrium and rumor-existence equilibrium, calculated the basic reproduction number of our model. With numerical simulations, we illustrated the effect of parameter changes on rumor spreading, analyzing the parameter sensitivity of the model. The results of the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations illustrated the conclusions of this study. People having different attitudes towards rumors may play different roles in the process of rumor spreading. It was surprising to find, in our research, that people who hesitate to spread rumors have a positive effect on the spread of rumors.

Abstract: False rumors can lead to huge economic losses or/and social instability. Hence, mitigating the impact of bogus rumors is of primary importance. This paper focuses on the problem of how to suppress a false rumor by use of the truth. Based on a set of rational hypotheses and a novel rumor-truth mixed spreading model, the effectiveness and cost of a rumor-containing strategy are quantified, respectively. On this basis, the original problem is modeled as a constrained optimization problem (the RC model), in which the independent variable and the objective function represent a rumor-containing strategy and the effectiveness of a rumor-containing strategy, respectively. The goal of the optimization problem is to find the most effective rumor-containing strategy subject to a limited rumor-containing budget. Some optimal rumor-containing strategies are given by solving their respective RC models. The influence of different factors on the highest cost effectiveness of a RC model is illuminated through computer experiments. The results obtained are instructive to develop effective rumor-containing strategies.

A perceptual and behavioral analysis of facial cues to deception in interactions between children and a virtual agent,

Abstract: This study focused on the facial expressions that children exhibit while trying to deceive a virtual agent. An interactive lie elicitation game was developed to record children’s facial expressions during deceptive and truthful utterances. Our participants did this task either alone or in the presence of peers. A manual method and an automatic recognition approach were used to examine facial expressions and facial action units (AUs). Results show that the facial expressions of deceivers differ from those of truth-tellers: most clearly, they try to cover their lie as they smile significantly more often than truthful children. Moreover, co-presence enhances children’s facial expressive behavior and the number of deceptive cues. To understand whether such features serve as cues for deception detection, using data from children playing alone or together with another child, a perception test was carried out to examine observers’ ability to distinguish young deceivers from truth-tellers. Results show that observers found it easier to discriminate between deceivers and truth-tellers who had played the game in the co-present condition. Our research thus shows that virtual agents can be used as tools to elicit lies in a playful manner, which would be relevant for developmental, educational and behavioral analyses of deceit in growing children.

Abstract: Similar to the spread of infectious diseases, rumor spread has a significant impact on human lives. As the saying goes, “rumors end with the wise” and the proportion of the wisemen in the crowd has a certain influence on the spread of rumors. Based on this fact, a rumor transmission model considering the proportion of wisemen in the crows is established. It provides a new angle of view on the issue of rumor spreading. Different from previous studies, we consider the speed of rumor propagation as the variable over time in our model. Then, locally asymptotic stability of each of the feasible equilibriums is presented by using Routh–Hurwitz criteria. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the feasibility of our results and the influence of different parameters on the rumor spreading. The results in this paper provide theoretical support to rumor control.

Abstract: A group in a mobile social network is normally considered as a particular contact in which invited individuals can share messages. People in a mobile social network sometimes share rumor messages with the contacts in the group that are not necessarily familiar with them. They normally get the rumor messages posted by different users and forward them to the other individuals or groups. There are some models for analysis of rumor propagation in mobile social networks. However, none of them have considered the concept of rumor propagation into groups of nodes. In this paper we study the rumor spreading in mobile social networks when the concept of group propagation is also considered. For this purpose, we extend the SIR information propagation model and investigate the impact of group propagation on the dynamics of rumor spreading process. We conduct steady-state analysis to investigate the basic reproduction number of the rumor spreading in the model. Furthermore, agent-based modeling and simulation is used to analyze the final size of the rumor under various group propagation rates as well as the impacts of group parameters on group spreading dynamics. The simulation results obtained by Monte Carlo method show that group propagation effectively increases the rumor spreading speed. We show that having large groups is more effective on rumor spreading than having more groups. Furthermore we analyze the influence of network structure on rumor spreading when group propagation is considered. For this purpose, two Erdős–Rényi and Barabási–Albert models of social networks are considered and it is shown that rumor spreading behavior in these networks have no significant differences when we have rumor propagation in groups.

Abstract: The research of rumor spreading and controlling has become an important issue in social networks. In this paper, we propose a novel rumor and authoritative information propagation model considering the super spreading mechanism. We derive mean-field equations to describe the dynamics of the rumor and authoritative information propagation model. Then the basic reproduction number and the final size of rumor and authoritative information are estimated. Simulations are conducted in a Barabási–Albert scale-free network to verify the effectiveness by comparing the proposed model with real data in Sina Weibo and to analyze the dynamics of the model. The results show that the influence of super spreading mechanism on rumor is greater than that on authoritative information. The presence of the super spreading mechanism only on rumor will cause explosive growth of the final rumor spreading size. Besides, the stronger the force of authoritative information, the smaller the final rumor spreading size and the larger the final authoritative information size. What is more, the influence of the force of authoritative information to attract individuals to spread it has greater influence on the final rumor and authoritative information spreading size than the force to forbid spreading rumors. The results are useful to understand better the mechanism of rumor propagation and refutation in complex social networks.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel rumor spreading model in consideration of the individuals’ subjective judgment and diverse characteristics. To reflect the diversity of the individuals’ characteristics, we introduce two probability distribution functions, which could be chosen arbitrarily or given by empirical data, to characterize individuals’ mastering degree of knowledge with respect to the domain of a specific rumor and individuals’ rationality degree. Different from existing models, no two persons in our model are identical, and each individual can judge the authenticity of the information, e.g., rumors, with his distinctive characteristics. In addition, by means of the mean-field method, we establish the expression of the dynamics of the rumor propagation in the complex heterogeneous networks and derive the rumor spreading threshold. Through the theoretical analysis, we find that the threshold is independent of the forms of the two introduced functions. Furthermore, we prove the stability of the rumor-free equilibrium set E0. That is if and only if R0<1, the rumor-free equilibrium set E0 is globally asymptotically stable. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical simulations to verify the theoretical results and comprehensively illustrate the evolution of the model. The simulation results show that because of the diversity of individuals’ characteristics, it becomes more difficult for the rumor to disseminate in the networks and the higher the mean of knowledge and the mean of rationality are, the more time it will take for the model to evolve to the steady state.

Abstract: Rumor spreading is an important form of social communication, and it will cause unnecessary panic and conflict to society. This paper aims to investigate the combined impact of the internal and external factors on the efficiency of rumor spreading over the social networks. In this paper, firstly, a modified ISR rumor spreading model on heterogeneous networks by taking into account the activity and infectivity of nodes and propagation environment was introduced. Then, through theoretical analysis, we derive the mean field equations with considering nonlinear spreading rate and active network nodes. Next, we calculate the basic reproduction number ℜ0 based on the next generation matrix method whose results reveal that if ℜ0<1, the rumor-free equilibrium is global asymptotically stable, the rumors will disappear. If ℜ0>1, the rumor-endemic equilibrium is global attractivity, then the number of spreaders will remain stable and the rumors will become endemic. Further, some numerical simulations are performed, which is consistent with the deterministic mean-field approach. Our results show that it is very important to consider the internal and external factors to control the spread of the rumors.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet and online communities has greatly increased the number and transmission speed of online rumors. To take more effective measures to counter the negative effects of these rumors, researchers and companies should understand the underlying mechanism of online rumor transmission. Therefore, this study takes an early initiative by focusing on users’ arguments in online discussion forums on the rumors and their effects on an individual’s belief in rumor and belief change, which is guided by the informational cascade and group polarization theories. In turn, belief and belief change on the online rumor lead to intention to spread the rumor. A lab experiment was conducted to test research hypotheses. The results, implications, limitations of the study, and conclusion are presented.

Abstract: Lying is a form of communication that involves two parties: the deceiver and the deceived. The deceiver intends to communicate false impressions or information. The deceived, however, must participate in the lie—at least on some level. This is either by virtue of learned apathy, ignorance, bias, or overconfidence (barring mental infirmity, of course). Human beings are gullible for a number of reasons, including a general tendency to believe others are telling the truth, and to be cognitively overwhelmed, and then irrationally convinced, by emotional arguments and displays. Consequently, allegations of crime laden with heavy emotion are more likely to believed (irrespective of the facts and evidence)—given the prevalence of Truth Bias and the Affect Heuristic, especially in the presence of other factors that tend to increase overall gullibility. Lies generally manifest as one of the following constructs of dishonesty: Complete Deception; Half-Truths; Exaggerations; and Pertinent Omissions. Lies are told for one of two reasons: either the deceptive person believes they have more to gain from lying than from telling the truth; or the deceptive person is incapable of discerning what the truth is, either temporarily or owing to some permanent mental defect. Lies may be divided into two distinct motivational categories: prosocial lies that are constructed to benefit others; and antisocial lies that are selfish. There is no technique or piece of technology that is capable of reliably determining whether someone is telling a lie. The scientific research demonstrates that most people do not detect lies with much greater accuracy than they would than chance (e.g., a coin toss); and the so-called “experts” in deception detection fair only slightly better. Pseudoscientific techniques of deception detection persist because they are subjective and open to interpretation. Subjective interpretations mean that analysts can shape the character of results in favor of prevailing political winds or to favor any preferred narrative.

Abstract: The recent computer graphics developments have upraised the quality of the generated digital content, astonishing the most skeptical viewer. Games and movies have taken advantage of this fact but, at the same time, these advances have brought serious negative impacts like the ones yielded by fake images produced with malicious intents. Digital artists can compose artificial images capable of deceiving the great majority of people, turning this into a very dangerous weapon in a timespan currently know as “Fake News/Post-Truth” Era. In this work, we propose a new approach for dealing with the problem of detecting computer generated images, through the application of deep convolutional networks and transfer learning techniques. We start from Residual Networks and develop different models adapted to the binary problem of identifying if an image was, or not, computer generated. Differently from the current state-of-the-art approaches, we do not rely on hand-crafted features, but provide to the model the raw pixel information, achieving the same 0.97 performance of state-of-the-art methods with three main advantages: (i) executes considerably faster than state-of-the-art methods with equivalent accuracy; (ii) eliminates the laborious and manual step of specialized features extraction and selection, and (iii) is very robust against image processing operations as noise addition, blur and JPEG compression.

Abstract: In the context of Internet and Communications Technology (ICT), this research investigates the acceptance of hate rumor and its consequence during a community crisis situation. Extending prior rumor research for this context, we develop and test a refined model using data collected from victims of a large scale (hate) rumor spread incident. Our data analyses present three main findings. First, during the crisis situation, platform characteristics of media synchronicity and richness of expression affected the likelihood of rumor recipients believing the false rumor to be a true message. Second, rumors received from people with closer social ties were more likely to be believed as true. Third, rumor belief during the crisis was associated with greater intensity of informational and behavioral actions. Our findings provide governments with insights to mitigate the spread of hate rumor especially under community disaster situations. Implications for research and policy are discussed. This paper contributes to the IS literature on rumor theory and its implications by explaining how diverse communication technologies are used in a community crisis, thereby opening new avenue for future research to address the negative consequences of using communication media in the complex ICT mediated world. It shows how media characteristics along with social ties affect the “politics of plausibility”.

Abstract: Online social networks have become the hotbeds of many rumors as information can propagate much faster than ever. In order to detect the few but potentially harmful rumors to prevent the public issues they may cause, we propose an unsupervised learning model combining Recurrent Neural Networks and Autoencoders to distinguish rumors as anomalies from other credible microblogs based on users’ behaviors. Some features based on comments posted by other users are newly proposed and are then analyzed over their posting time so as to exploit the crowd wisdom to improve the detection performance. The experimental results show that our model achieves a high accuracy of 92.49% and F1 measure of 89.16%.

Abstract: Rumor spreading is a typical form of social communication and plays a significant role in social life, and media coverage has a great influence on the spread of rumor. In this paper, we present a new model with two media coverage to investigate the impact of the different mediums on rumor spreading. Then, we calculate the equilibria of the model and construct the reproduction number ℜ0. And we prove the global asymptotic stability of equilibria by using Lyapunov functions. Finally, we can conclude that the transition rate of the ignorants between two mediums has a direct effect on the scale of spreaders, and different media coverage has significant effects on the dynamics behaviors of rumor spreading.

Abstract: The authenticity of Information has become a longstanding issue affecting businesses and society, both for printed and digital media. On social networks, the reach and effects of information spread occur at such a fast pace and so amplified that distorted, inaccurate or false information acquires a tremendous potential to cause real world impacts, within minutes, for millions of users. Recently, several public concerns about this problem and some approaches to mitigate the problem were expressed. In this paper, we discuss the problem by presenting the proposals into categories: content based, source based and diffusion based. We describe two opposite approaches and propose an algorithmic solution that synthesizes the main concerns. We conclude the paper by raising awareness about concerns and opportunities for businesses that are currently on the quest to help automatically detecting fake news by providing web services, but who will most certainly, on the long term, profit from their massive usage.

Abstract: An important contribution in sociophysics is the Galam’s model of rumors spreading. This model provides an explanation of rumors spreading in a population and explains some interesting social phenomena such as the diffusion of hoaxes. In this paper the model has been reformulated as a Markov process highlighting the stochastic nature of the phenomena. This formalization allows us to derive conditions for consensus to be reached and for the existence of some interesting phenomena such as the emergence of impasses. The proposed formulation allows a deeper and more comprehensive analysis of the diffusion of rumors.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that the most important determinant of deception detection success was the perceived credibility of the sender. If so, then what accounts for differences in perceived sender credibility, especially when communication is conducted solely via computer-mediated communication modes where sender and receiver cannot see each other? We investigated the relationships between credibility, its antecedents, deception detection success, and the generation of false alarms. We conducted an experiment involving 74 pairs of undergraduate students. We found that the perceived credibility of the sender significantly affected both detection success and false alarms, such that the less credible the sender, the better the detection and the more false alarms generated. We also found significant relationships between three of the four antecedents and credibility: participants who were trained to detect cues to deception, who were motivated to find deception, and who communicated via e-mail were more likely to perceive senders as not credible, compared to participants who were not trained, not motivated, and who communicated via VOIP. Our findings have implications for both research and practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rumor transmission model with incubation period and constant recruitment in social networks. By carrying out an analysis of the model, we study the stability of rumor-free equilibrium and come to the local stable condition of the rumor equilibrium. We use the geometric approach for ordinary differential equations for showing the global stability of the rumor equilibrium. And when ℜ0=1, the new model occurs a transcritical bifurcation. Furthermore, numerical simulations are used to support the analysis. At last, some conclusions are presented.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose I2S2R rumor spreading model with general incidence function in homogeneous networks and I2S2R rumor spreading model in heterogeneous network. In the first model, we establish a dynamic model for rumor propagation called I2S2R, in which we consider two general incidence functions. Then the basic reproduction number, the locally stability and the global stability of rumor-free equilibrium are discussed. In the second model, we mainly consider another network structure, i.e. heterogeneous network. Thus, we propose a new dynamic model for rumor spreading. By deriving the mean-field equation, the basic reproduction number is obtained. Moreover, the global stability of rumor-free equilibrium is established by comparison principle. By using a monotone iterative algorithm, the global attractivity of the positive equilibrium is proved. Finally, we obtain some important conclusions with numerical simulations.

Abstract: Many rumors convey information about potential danger, even when these dangers are very unlikely. In four studies, we examine whether micro-processes of cultural transmission explain the spread of threat-related information. Three studies using transmission chain protocols suggest a) that there is indeed a preference for the deliberate transmission of threat-related information over other material, b) that it is not caused by a general negativity or emotionality bias, and c) that it is not eliminated when threats are presented as very unlikely. A forced-choice study on similar material shows the same preference when participants have to select information to acquire rather than transmit. So the cultural success of threat-related material may be explained by transmission biases, rooted in evolved threat-detection and error-management systems, that affect both supply and demand of information.

Abstract: We explore the impact of punishment of governments and sensitivity of individuals on the rumor spreading in this paper. Considering the facts that some rumors that relate to the hot events could be disseminated repeatedly, however, some other rumors will never be disseminated after they have been popular for some time. Therefore, we investigate two types (SIS and SIR) of rumor spreading models in which the punishment of government and sensitivity of individuals are considered. Based on the mean-field method, we have calculated the spreading threshold of SIS and SIR model, respectively. Furthermore, we perform the rumor spreading process in the Facebook and POK social networks, and achieve that there is an excellent agreement between the theoretical and numerical results of spreading threshold. The results indicate that improving the punishment of government and increasing the sensitivity of individuals could control the spreading of rumor effectively.

Abstract: The massive diffusion of online social media allows for the rapid and uncontrolled spreading of conspiracy theories, hoaxes, unsubstantiated claims, and false news. Such an impressive amount of misinformation can influence policy preferences and encourage behaviors strongly divergent from recommended practices. In this paper, we study the statistical properties of viral misinformation in online social media. By means of methods belonging to Extreme Value Theory, we show that the number of extremely viral posts over time follows a homogeneous Poisson process, and that the interarrival times between such posts are independent and identically distributed, following an exponential distribution. Moreover, we characterize the uncertainty around the rate parameter of the Poisson process through Bayesian methods. Finally, we are able to derive the predictive posterior probability distribution of the number of posts exceeding a certain threshold of shares over a finite interval of time.

Abstract: During terror attacks, information with unknown credibility might circulate and people use rumors to compensate for information gaps. On 06.12.2014, three teenagers were kidnapped from a bus station in the West Bank and found dead after several days. A gag order was issued, causing interest in alternative sources of information. This study investigated how information spread through WhatsApp during the search operation using a participatory research approach. 13 rumors circulating on WhatsApp were collected, nine of which were verified, and found to be true. A web-based survey revealed that 61.1% of 419 respondents received information regarding the kidnapping through WhatsApp; 38.9% through Facebook. Sources of two rumors and participation of emergency authorities in rumor dissemination were identified. Some rumors originated from the family and community of the abductees, while other WhatsApp messages included information and names of two abductees, which were not public at the time. When emergency authorities share unconfirmed information, it is perceived as more credible than information spread by citizens. During the operation, official representatives did not correct or refute any rumors. Locating the source of a rumor is challenging and thus it is important to actively investigate rumors in real-time in order to locate the source.

Abstract: There are some similarities between the rumor spreading and the infectious disease transmission. In this paper, we investigate rumor spreading dynamics with the activity of spreaders based on compartment model in the homogeneous network. Different from previous studies, each spreader individual in network rotates between high active and low active state according to certain probabilities. We introduce a dynamic model for the rumor spreading called I2SR, in which we consider the activity of nodes and divide spreaders into spreaders with the high rate of active state and the low rate of active spreaders. Then, the locally asymptotic stability of equilibrium is established by using Routh–Hurwitz criteria. The global stability of internal equilibrium of model is proved based on Lasalle’s invariance principle. Finally, numerical simulations are carried to illustrate the impact of different parameters on the rumor spreading.

Abstract: Deception is an inevitable component of human interaction. Researchers and practitioners are developing information systems to aid in the detection of deceptive communication. Information systems are typically adopted by end users to aid in completing a goal or objective (e.g., increasing the efficiency of a business process). However, end-user interactions with deception detection systems (adversarial systems) are unique because the goals of the system and the user are orthogonal. Prior work investigating systems-based deception detection has focused on the identification of reliable deception indicators. This research extends extant work by looking at how users of deception detection systems alter their behavior in response to the presence of guilty knowledge, relevant stimuli, and system knowledge. An analysis of data collected during two laboratory experiments reveals that guilty knowledge, relevant stimuli, and system knowledge all lead to increased use of countermeasures. The implications and limitations of this research are discussed and avenues for future research are outlined.

Abstract: Rumor cause unnecessary conflicts and confusion by misleading the cognition of the public, its spreading has largely influence on human affairs. All kinds of rumors and people’s suspicion are often caused by the lack of official information. Hence, the official should take a variety of channels to deny the rumors. The promotion of scientific knowledge is implemented to improve the quality of the whole nation, reduce the harm caused by rumor spreading. In this paper, regarding the process of the science education that official deny the rumor many times as periodic impulse, we propose a XWYZ rumor spreading model with impulse vaccination and time delay, and analyze the global dynamics behaviors of the model. By using the discrete dynamical system determined by the comparison theory and Floquet theorem, we show that there exists a rumor-free periodic solution. Further, we show that the rumor-free periodic solution is globally attractive under appropriate conditions. We also obtain a sufficient condition for the permanence of model. Finally, with the numerical simulation, our results indicate that large vaccination rate, short impulse period or long latent period is sufficient condition for the extinction of the rumors.

Abstract: Lies and deceptions are prevalent in our daily lives, yet most people merely guess when attempting to distinguish between lies and truths. In the current research, we examined the validity of the saying that “it takes a thief to know a thief” by showing that it takes a good liar – one high in attachment insecurity – to detect another liar. In Study 1, 68 card players participated in a Bullshit tournament – a card game in which players try to deceive other players while also striving to detect their deceptions. In Study 2 (N=99), people who cheated on their romantic partner (versus those who did not) were asked to detect cues of infidelity. Results confirmed our expectations and showed that good liars and cheaters, who are usually insecure individuals, are better at detecting lies and dishonesty. These results are discussed from the perspective of social defense theory, highlighting the utility of personality traits that are often deemed maladaptive.

Abstract: Deception is a common part of everyday discourse, and while much is known about deception and traditional face-to-face communication, relatively little is known about deception and its detection when the communication is computer-mediated. A recent meta-analysis (Bond & DePaulo, 2008) showed that the largest determinant of deception detection success in traditional non-mediated communication was the perceived credibility of the sender. Does this conclusion also hold for computer-mediated communication and deception detection? Using Prominence-Interpretation Theory (PIT; Fogg, 2003) and Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT; Buller & Burgoon, 1996), we investigated the relationships among media, credibility and its antecedents, and deception detection. We expanded PIT using key concepts from IDT, resulting in what we call expanded PIT (EPIT). We created a model of EPIT and derived seven propositions from it. We argue that EPIT is a useful approach to investigating deception detection in a computer-mediated communication context and that it also has potential as a more general purpose theory.

Abstract: Network immunization is an effective strategy for restraining virus spreading in computer networks and rumor propagation in social networks. Currently, lots of strategies are proposed based on topological structures of networks, such as degree-based and betweenness-based network immunization strategies. However, these studies assume that nodes in a network are homogeneous, i.e., each node has the same characteristic. However, more and more studies have revealed the heterogeneous characteristic of a network. For example, the activities of individual in a computer and social network play an important role in virus spreading and rumor propagation. Some active individuals can promote the outbreak of virus and the spread of a rumor. In this paper, a new network immunization strategy is proposed through combining the characteristics of network structure with node activities. Comprehensive experiments in both benchmark and synthetic networks show that our proposed strategy can restrain virus prorogation effectively.

Abstract: The tipping point framework of lie detection posits that people can, and do, accurately detect deception. This framework pinpoints three circumstances that aid accuracy: (i) using methods of measurement that circumvent controlled, conscious cognition; (ii) when individual differences or situational factors portend potent risks to lie detection failure, such as in high-stakes or threatening settings; and (iii) when factors diminish concern over the relationship or reputation costs of asserting that someone has lied. We thus depict a psychological system that registers lie detection consistently in nonconscious reactions (e.g., brain based, bodily, indirect social evaluations) and that allows information into consciousness to inform overt assessments of lies when the costs of failing to detect deception exceed those of signaling distrust.

Abstract: Rumor is an important form of social interaction and its spreading has a significant impact on human lives. Accounting to rumors’ spread, we present a way of analysis on interaction between two processes, and a frame about the dissemination of scientific knowledge in order to prevent rumor transition. Based on this analysis, a 4D dynamic model is established and numerical simulations are performed. Mathematical analysis of the system with regard to boundedness of solutions, local and global stability of the feasible equilibria and persistence of the system are presented. When the rate of scientific knowledge dissemination reaches a critical value, it can be concluded that the strictly positive interior equilibria undergoes Hopf-bifurcation. The rumor spreading rate also plays an important role on the dynamic behavior of our system, which can be showed from our simulation results that lower rumor spreading rate drives the rumormongers to extinction.

Abstract: This study explores how the public’s belief in false rumors about Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that spread across South Korea related to their accuracy-oriented information seeking as well as the moderating effects of people’s reasons for using social networking services (SNS). The survey results show that perceived credibility of false rumors did not affect accuracy-oriented information seeking. However, a significant result was shown in the moderating effect, such that SNS informational dependency interacted with false rumor credibility on accuracy-oriented information seeking. Overall, this study specifically identifies and discusses differences in SNS dependency and accuracy-oriented information seeking in the context of rumor communication to examine the construction of an informed public. Theoretical contributions of this study are discussed.

Abstract: Recent studies of rumor or information diffusion process in complex networks show that in contrast to traditional comprehension, individuals who participate in rumor spreading within one network do not always get the rumor from their neighbors. They can obtain the rumor from different sources like online social networks and then publish it on their personal sites. In our paper, we discuss this phenomenon in complex networks by adopting the concept of independent spreaders. Rather than getting the rumor from neighbors, independent spreaders learn it from other channels. We further develop the classic “ignorant-spreaders-stiflers” or SIR model of rumor diffusion process in complex networks. A steady-state analysis is conducted to investigate the final spectrum of the rumor spreading under various spreading rate, stifling rate, density of independent spreaders and average degree of the network. Results show that independent spreaders effectively enhance the rumor diffusion process, by delivering the rumor to regions far away from the current rumor infected regions. And though the rumor spreading process in SF networks is faster than that in ER networks, the final size of rumor spreading in ER networks is larger than that in SF networks.

Abstract: Behavioral cues to deception are instrumental in detecting deception. As one of the primary sources of deception behavior, text has been analyzed at the level of sub-sentence or message but not the discourse of interaction. Additionally, empirical studies on cues to deception in the case of multiple receivers remain nonexistent. To fill these voids, we propose a discourse framework and six hypotheses about deception behaviors in a multi-receiver environment. The deception behaviors are operationalized by discourse features based on an analysis of real-world data. The results of statistical analysis validate the efficacy of discourse features in discriminating deceivers from truth-tellers.

Abstract: When considering roles of realistic external forces (e.g. authorities) and internal forces (e.g. the forgetting nature of human), diffusion behaviors like spreading, stifling and forgetting behaviors are time-dependent. They were incorporated in an SIR-like rumor spreading model to investigate the effects to rumor spreading dynamics. Mean-field equations were derived, and the steady state analysis was conducted. Simulations were carried out on different complex networks. We demonstrated that the combination of the three variable diffusion behaviors provides a faster and larger spreading expansion capacity. Network structure matters considerably in rumor spreading dynamics.

Abstract: This study explored a psychophysiological measure, Resting Heart Rate (RHR), as a predicator of the ability to detect lies. RHR was recorded for 1min and followed by a deception detection task in which participants were required to judge 24 videos of people describing a real-life event (50% truthful, 50% deceptive). Multiple regression analyses showed that, among other individual characteristics, only RHR predicted the ability to distinguish truth from lies. Importantly, the prediction was negative. This result suggests that the higher the RHR, the worse the detection of lies. Since the RHR is considered to be a physiological trait indexing autonomous arousal, and since high-arousal states can lead to restricted attentional resources, we suggest that limited selection and utilization of cues due to restricted attention is the reason why higher RHR leads to poor deception detection.

Abstract: Considering the bipolar social reinforcement which includes positive and negative effects, in this paper we explore the rumor spreading dynamics in online social networks. By means of the generation function and cavity method developed from statistical physics of disordered system, the rumor spreading threshold can be theoretically drawn. Simulation results indicate that decreasing the positive reinforcement factor or increasing the negative reinforcement factor can suppress the rumor spreading effectively. By analyzing the topological properties of the real world social network, we find that the nodes with lower degree usually have smaller weight. However, the nodes with lower degree may have larger k-shell. In order to curb rumor spreading, some control strategies that are based on the nodes’ degree, k-shell and weight are presented. By comparison, we show that controlling those nodes that have larger degree or weight are two effective strategies to prevent the rumor spreading.

Abstract: The study of rumor spreading has become an important issue on complex social networks. On the basis of prior studies, we propose a modified ​susceptible–exposed–infected–removed (SEIR) model with hesitating mechanism by considering the attractiveness and fuzziness of the content of rumors. We derive mean-field equations to characterize the dynamics of SEIR model on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Then a steady-state analysis is conducted to investigate the spreading threshold and the final rumor size. Simulations on both artificial and real networks show that a decrease of fuzziness can effectively increase the spreading threshold of the SEIR model and reduce the maximum rumor influence. In addition, the spreading threshold is independent of the attractiveness of rumor. Simulation results also show that the speed of rumor spreading obeys the relation “BA network > WS network”, whereas the final scale of spreading obeys the opposite relation.

Abstract: Individuals predominantly exchange information with one another through informal, interpersonal channels. During disasters and other disrupted settings, information spread through informal channels regularly outpaces official information provided by public officials and the press. Social scientists have long examined this kind of informal communication in the rumoring literature, but studying rumoring in disrupted settings has posed numerous methodological challenges. Measuring features of informal communication–timing, content, location–with any degree of precision has historically been extremely challenging in small studies and infeasible at large scales. We address this challenge by using online, informal communication from a popular microblogging website and for which we have precise spatial and temporal metadata. While the online environment provides a new means for observing rumoring, the abundance of data poses challenges for parsing hazard-related rumoring from countless other topics in numerous streams of communication. Rumoring about disaster events is typically temporally and spatially constrained to places where that event is salient. Accordingly, we use spatio and temporal subsampling to increase the resolution of our detection techniques. By filtering out data from known sources of error (per rumor theories), we greatly enhance the signal of disaster-related rumoring activity. We use these spatio-temporal filtering techniques to detect rumoring during a variety of disaster events, from high-casualty events in major population centers to minimally destructive events in remote areas. We consistently find three phases of response: anticipatory excitation where warnings and alerts are issued ahead of an event, primary excitation in and around the impacted area, and secondary excitation which frequently brings a convergence of attention from distant locales onto locations impacted by the event. Our results demonstrate the promise of spatio-temporal filtering techniques for “tuning” measurement of hazard-related rumoring to enable observation of rumoring at scales that have long been infeasible.

Abstract: Deception essentially takes place in social interaction. While deception has been studied from the perspective of interpersonal interaction, little is known about social structural characteristics of deceptive communication. To fill the knowledge gap, this research investigates deception behavior in computer mediated communication (CMC) via the lens of social structure by answering the questions of how one deceiver socially interacts with multiple receivers and what structural characteristics can be used to delineate deception in CMC. To this end, we first conceptualize deception in terms of social structure by drawing on the interpersonal deception and social network theories. We then propose a model of structural behaviors of deception in CMC that consists of three components: centrality, cohesion, and similarity, followed by an empirical evaluation of the model with real-world data collected from a game website. The findings of this study provide new evidence that deception is a strategic activity where the deceiver juggles between the dual goals of promoting his or her deceptive agenda and avoiding detection.

Abstract: In this paper, based on growth and preferential attachment mechanism, we give a network generation model aiming at generating networks with community structure. There are three characteristics for the networks generated by the generation model. The first is that the community sizes can be nonuniform. The second is that there are bridge hubs in each community. The third is that the strength of community structure is adjustable. Next, we investigate rumor propagation behavior on the generated networks by performing Monte Carlo simulations to reveal the influence of bridge hubs, nonuniformity of community sizes and the strength of community structure on the dynamic behavior of the rumor propagation. We find that bridge hubs have outstanding performance in propagation speed and propagation size, and larger modularity can reduce rumor propagation. Furthermore, when the decay rate of rumor spreading β is large, the final density of the stiflers is larger if the rumor originates in larger community. Additionally, when on networks with different strengths of community structure, rumor propagation exhibits greater difference in the density of stiflers and in the peak prevalence if the decay rate β is larger.

Abstract: Well-designed video games can teach people to decrease their reliance on heuristics and biases, especially in deception detection, where people might be resistant to training or unaware that training is needed. We created the serious game VERITAS in which users ask questions of pre-recorded actors and attempt to determine the veracity of the answers supplied. The efficacy of the game was tested in two different experiments with college student players. We hypothesized that reducing reactance and enhancing self-affirmation of players would mitigate the resistance to training about bias relevant to a deception detection context. We found that compared to a traditional lecture, VERITAS players were more engaged and motivated by the training and outperformed the traditional lecture in training participants about their knowledge of deception cues, and to identify truthful statements but not deceptive ones. The players of VERITAS also showed improvement from the first to the second scenario in the game. These results reveal that perhaps truth and deception detection are separate skills which require different types of training.

Abstract: The propagating dynamics of more than one rumor has received a substantial amount of attention in recent years. To investigate the effects of interactions between two rumors under symmetric conditions, we built a model based on an ordinary differential equation system while assuming that each individual’s spreading rate after receiving one rumor depends on whether he/she knows the other rumor. In certain cases, two rumors accelerate the spread of each other, while in a portion of the other cases they impede or decelerate the spread of each other. We discuss these effects by dividing the total population into nine groups that correspond to nine states, and we subsequently build the mean-field equations for the two-rumor interaction based on the SIR model in a homogeneous complex network, and we find their numerical solution with varying interaction factors for the rates of spreading and becoming disinterested. The results show that when we change these interaction factors, the density curves of the nine states and their maximum values will change accordingly by a series of rules, which demonstrates the corresponding effects when there is a positive or negative interaction between the two rumors. Our work could establish a foundation for further study of this issue.

Abstract: The concept of denial is introduced on rumor spreading processes. The denials occur with a certain rate and they reset to start the initial situation. A population of N individuals is subdivided into ignorants, spreaders and stiflers; at the initial time there is only one spreader and the rest of the population is ignorant. The denials are introduced in the classic DK model and in its generalization, in which a spreader can transmit the rumor at most to k ignorants. The steady state densities are analyzed for these models. Finally, a numerical analysis is performed to study the rule of the involved parameters and to compare the proposed models.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the rumor diffusion process according to the evolutionary game framework. By using three real social network datasets, we find that increasing the judgment ability of individuals could curb the diffusion of rumor effectively. Under the same level of punishment cost, there are more spreaders in the network that has larger average degree. Moreover, the punishment fraction has more significant impact than the risk coefficient on the controlling of rumor diffusion. There exist some optimal risk coefficients and punishment fractions that could help more people refusing to spread rumor. In addition, the effect of the tie strength on the final fraction of spreaders is investigated. The results indicate that the rumor can be suppressed soon if the individuals preferentially select the neighbor either weaker or stronger ties persistently to update their strategy. However, choosing neighbor blindly may promote the spread of rumor. Finally, by comparing three kinds of punishment mechanisms, we show that taking the lead in punishing the higher degree nodes is the most effective measure to reduce the coverage of rumor.

Abstract: In this paper, a modified susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) model has been proposed to explore rumor diffusion on complex social networks. We take variation of connectivity into consideration and assume the variation as noise. On the basis of related literature on virus networks, the noise is described as standard Brownian motion while stochastic differential equations (SDE) have been derived to characterize dynamics of rumor diffusion both on homogeneous networks and heterogeneous networks. Then, theoretical analysis on homogeneous networks has been demonstrated to investigate the solution of SDE model and the steady state of rumor diffusion. Simulations both on Barabási–Albert (BA) network and Watts–Strogatz (WS) network display that the addition of noise accelerates rumor diffusion and expands diffusion size, meanwhile, the spreading speed on BA network is much faster than on WS network under the same noise intensity. In addition, there exists a rumor diffusion threshold in statistical average meaning on homogeneous network which is absent on heterogeneous network. Finally, we find a positive correlation between peak value of infected individuals and noise intensity while a negative correlation between rumor lifecycle and noise intensity overall.

Abstract: Online Social Networks (OSNs) constitute one of the most important communication channels and are widely utilized as news sources. Information spreads widely and rapidly in OSNs through the word-of-mouth effect. However, it is not uncommon for misinformation to propagate in the network. Misinformation dissemination may lead to undesirable effects, especially in cases where the non-credible information concerns emergency events. Therefore, it is essential to timely limit the propagation of misinformation. Towards this goal, we suggest a novel propagation model, namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model, that effectively captures the way contradictory information, i.e., misinformation and credible information, propagates in the network. The DLT model considers the probability of a user alternating between competing beliefs, assisting in either the propagation of misinformation or credible news. Based on the DLT model, we formulate an optimization problem that under cost constraints aims in identifying the most appropriate subset of users to limit the spread of misinformation by initiating the propagation of credible information. We prove that our suggested approach achieves an approximation ratio of 1−1/e and demonstrate by experimental evaluation that it outperforms its competitors.

Abstract: Similarities exist between the rumor spreading and the infectious disease transmission. Some researches on the disease spreading involve two or more diseases which are cross-infection propagation. Similarly, two or several kinds of rumors may spread at the same time. In this paper, we study a rumor spreading model called 2SI2R model, in which two types of rumors spread simultaneously among the crowd. Derived from mean-field equations, the dynamics of the 2SI2R rumor spreading model in homogeneous networks is elucidated. Employing the method on infectious diseases, the basic reproduction number, the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, and the final size of rumor are investigated and discussed. In the numerical simulation part, the interaction of two rumors and the impact of different parameters on the rumor spreading are discussed.

Abstract: Rumor is an important form of social interaction. However, spreading of harmful rumors could have a significant negative impact on the well-being of the society. In this paper, considering the counterattack mechanism of the rumor spreading, we introduce two new models: Susceptible–Infective–Counterattack–Refractory (SICR) model and adjusted-SICR model. We then derive mean-field equations to describe their dynamics in homogeneous networks and conduct the steady-state analysis. We also introduce the self-resistance parameter τ, and study the influence of this parameter on rumor spreading. Numerical simulations are performed to compare the SICR model with the SIR model and the adjusted-SICR model, respectively, and we investigate the spreading peak of the rumor and the final size of the rumor with various parameters. Simulation results are congruent exactly with the theoretical analysis. The experiment reveals some interesting patterns of rumor spreading involved with counterattack force.

Abstract: Individuals trying to conceal knowledge from interrogators are likely to experience raised levels of stress that can manifest itself across biological, physiological, psychological and behavioural factors, providing an opportunity for detection. Using established research paradigms an innovative scalable interrogation was designed in which participants were given a ‘token’ that represented information they had to conceal from interviewers. A control group did not receive a token and therefore did not have to deceive the investigators. The aim of this investigation was to examine differences between deceivers and truth-tellers across the four factors by collecting data for cortisol levels, sweat samples, heart-rate, respiration, skin temperature, subjective stress ratings and video and audio recordings. The results provided an integrated understanding of responses to interrogation by those actively concealing information and those acting innocently. Of particular importance, the results also suggest, for the first time in an interrogation setting, that stressed individuals may secrete a volatile steroid based marker that could be used for stand-off detection. The findings are discussed in relation to developing a scalable interrogation protocol for future research in this area.

Abstract: Compared with the epidemic spreading, rumor spreading has some specific characteristics. In this paper, we supplement some realistic conditions on previous rumor spreading models, then develop a new rumor spreading model called SIRaRu model. The mean-field equations are derived to describe the dynamics of the SIRaRu rumor spreading in complex networks, associated with which the steady-state analysis is carried out, indicating the spreading threshold existing in both homogeneous networks and inhomogeneous networks. Meanwhile, we discuss the rumor immunization strategy and obtain the immunization threshold and spreading thresholds in homogeneous and inhomogeneous networks, respectively. Numerical simulations are conducted in complex networks, showing that the network topology exerts significant influence on the rumor spreading. The final size of the rumor is greatly impacted by the forgetting rate.

Abstract: Rumor transmission has become an important issue in emergency event. In this paper, a rumor transmission model with Holling-type II functional response was proposed, which provides excellent explanations of the scientific knowledge effect with rumor spreading. By a global analysis of the model and studying the stability of the rumor-free equilibrium and the rumor-endemic equilibrium, we found that the number of infective individuals equal to zero or positive integer as time went on. A numerical simulation is carried out to illustrate the feasibility of our main results. The results will provide the theoretical support to rumor control in emergency event and also provide decision makers references for the public opinions management.

Abstract: Polygraph tests have been used to detect deception for almost a century. Yet for almost as long, the validity of these tests has been criticized. Over the last decade, the use of brain imaging – most notably fMRI - for the detection of deception has attracted increased attention. The expectation is that fMRI can overcome – at least some of - the shortcomings of the polygraph. In this review, we discuss whether this expectation is warranted. Based on our review of the empirical evidence, we argue that fMRI deception research has boosted the theory development of deception. But for practical purposes, fMRI research has thus far done surprisingly little to solve or circumvent the problems than have been associated with deception research for ages.

Abstract: With the prevalence of new media, e.g., microblogging, rumors spread faster and wider than ever before. On the basis of prior studies, this paper modifies a flow chart of the rumor spreading process with the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered) model, and thus makes the rumor spreading process more realistic and apparent. The authors believe that ignorants will inevitably change their status once they are made aware of a rumor by spreaders; the probabilities that a spreader becomes a stifler are differentiated in accordance with reality. In the numerical simulation part, the impact that variations of different parameters have on the rumor spreading process will be analyzed.

Recently, considerable scientific effort has been devoted to creating robust and reliable methodologies of analysis to be implemented. The need for rapid, accurate and sensitive detection methods to detect and monitor adulterations in foods has been one of the main objectives in the food industry. Vibrational spectroscopy and the role of chemometrics in extracting chemically-relevant information have led to the development of several applications in the field of fraud adulteration.

Abstract: In this paper, a rumor diffusion model with uncertainty of human behavior under spatio-temporal diffusion framework is established. Take physical significance of spatial diffusion into account, a diffusion threshold is set under which the rumor is not a trend topic and only spreads along determined physical connections. Heterogeneity of degree distribution and distance distribution has also been considered in theoretical model at the same time. The global existence and uniqueness of classical solution are proved with a Lyapunov function and an approximate classical solution in form of infinite series is constructed with a system of eigenfunction. Simulations and numerical solutions both on Watts–Strogatz (WS) network and Barabási–Albert (BA) network display the variation of density of infected connections from spatial and temporal dimensions. Relevant results show that the density of infected connections is dominated by network topology and uncertainty of human behavior at threshold time. With increase of social capability, rumor diffuses to the steady state in a higher speed. And the variation trends of diffusion size with uncertainty are diverse on different artificial networks.

Abstract: With the rapid development of information networks, negative impacts of rumor propagation become more serious. Nowadays, knowing the mechanisms of rumor propagation and having an efficient official rumor refutation plan play very important roles in reducing losses and ensuring social safety. In this paper we first develop the dynamic 8-state ICSAR (Ignorance, Information Carrier, Information Spreader, Information Advocate, Removal) rumor propagation model to study the mechanism of rumor propagation. Eight influencing factors including information attraction, objective identification of rumors, subjective identification of people, the degree of trust of information media, spread probability, reinforcement coefficient, block value and expert effects which are related to rumor propagation were analyzed. Next, considering these factors and mechanisms of rumor propagation and refutation, the dynamic 8-state ICSAR rumor propagation model is verified by the SIR epidemic model, computer simulation and actual data. Thirdly, through quantitative sensitivity analysis, the detailed function of each influencing factor was studied and shown in the figure directly. According to these mechanisms, we could understand how to block a rumor in a very efficient way and which methods should be chosen in different situations. The ICSAR model can divide people into 8 states and analyze rumor and anti-rumor dissemination in an accurate way. Furthermore, official rumor refutation is considered in rumor propagation. The models and the results are essential for improving the efficiency of rumor refutation and making emergency plans, which help to reduce the possibility of losses in disasters and rumor propagation.

Abstract: A rumor spreading model with the consideration of forgetting rate changing over time is examined in small-world networks. The mean-field equations are derived to describe the dynamics of rumor spreading in small-world networks. Further, numerical solutions are conducted on LiveJournal, an online social blogging platform, to better understand the performance of the model. Results show that the forgetting rate has a significant impact on the final size of rumor spreading: the larger the initial forgetting rate or the faster the forgetting speed, the smaller the final size of the rumor spreading. Numerical solutions also show that the final size of rumor spreading is much larger under a variable forgetting rate compared to that under a constant forgetting rate.

Abstract: Education remains one of the fundamental factors in people’s lives. The education rate of a population reflects the degree of vulnerability of a typical individual to any kind of information. In general, one distinguishes two types of individuals in a population: educated individuals and non-educated individuals. Unlike an educated individual, a non-educated individual has a high chance to accept any untrue information (rumor). In this study, the classical SIR rumor spreading model is extended to consider the forgetting mechanism and population’s education rate, to thus yield the SEIR rumor spreading model. A system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describes the dynamical behavior of the SEIR rumor spreading model is derived. Further, analyses of our model are carried out to determine the rumor final size and to investigate the impact of education rate on the rumor final size. Our analytical and numerical results show that the more there are educated individuals within a population, the smaller is the rumor final size. In brief, education significantly contributes to the rumor spreading cessation.

Abstract: Rumor diffusion on complex networks has been widely investigated assuming that an individual learns the rumor merely from its neighbors, which, however, is not always the case. Recent studies of layered models have shown that individuals belonging to many different networks can affect the spreading process on one network. In this paper, we take this phenomenon into consideration and discuss its influence on rumor diffusion in complex networks by introducing independent spreaders. Independent spreaders are nodes that know the rumor from other channels rather than their neighbors. A new stochastic technique is used to obtain the dynamics of rumor diffusion. Results reveal that independent spreaders boost the process by bringing the rumor to regions remote from current spreaders. In order to accelerate diffusion, we find that improving the network connectivity is more efficient than adding more independent spreaders.

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of EEG signals in suicidology, particularly for detection of suicidal ideation through data analysis of EEG signals elicit by reading of text notes, which may indicate genuine suicide attempt or a hoax suicide note. The role of emotion, attention, and memory in detection of suicidal ideation through perusal is studied. Also, the discriminatory role of alpha waves and beta waves is studied. Our study provides an important and interesting conclusion that prior experience or conditioned training in detection of suicide notes is not beneficial in discriminating between genuine and hoax suicide notes and that the brain signals are more discriminatory in participants with no prior experience or conditioning. Quantitatively, our results indicate that the beta waves in EEG channels related to memory can provide classification accuracy of more than 70%.

Abstract: The SIHR rumor spreading model with consideration of the forgetting and remembering mechanisms was studied in homogeneous networks. We further investigate the properties of the SIHR model in inhomogeneous networks. The SIHR model is refined and mean-field equations are derived to describe the dynamics of the rumor spreading model in inhomogeneous networks. Steady-state analysis is carried out, which shows no spreading threshold existing. Numerical simulations are conducted in a BA scale-free network. The simulation results show that the network topology exerts significant influences on the rumor spreading: In comparison with the ER network, the rumor spreads faster and the final size of the rumor is smaller in BA scale-free network; the forgetting and remembering mechanisms greatly impact the final size of the rumor. Finally, through the numerical simulation, we examine the effects that the spreading rate and the stifling rate have on the the influence of the rumor. In addition, the no threshold result is verified.

Abstract: SIR model is a classical model to simulate rumor spreading, while the supernetwork is an effective tool for modeling complex systems. Based on the Opinion SuperNetwork involving Social Sub-network, Environmental Sub-network, Psychological Sub-network, and Viewpoint Sub-network, drawing from the modeling idea of SIR model, this paper designs super SIC model (SSIC model) and its evolution rules, and also analyzes intervention effects on public opinion of four elements of supernetwork, which are opinion agent, opinion environment, agent’s psychology and viewpoint. Studies show that, the SSIC model based on supernetwork has effective intervention effects on rumor spreading. It is worth noting that (i) identifying rumor spreaders in Social Sub-network and isolating them can achieve desired intervention results, (ii) improving environmental information transparency so that the public knows as much information as possible to reduce the rumors is a feasible way to intervene, (iii) persuading wavering neutrals has better intervention effects than clarifying rumors already spread everywhere, so rumors should be intervened in properly in time by psychology counseling.

Abstract: Rumor propagation is a typical form of social communication and plays a significant role in social life. In this paper, we studied the process of rumor propagation by accounting for the mechanism of forgetting in Barrat–Barthelemy–Vespignani (BBV) networks. First, we derived mean-field equations for rumor propagation based on the strength of the nodes in the propagation network. We then analyzed the stability of the model to determine whether a propagation threshold existed in the BBV networks. We also conducted numerical simulations of the BBV networks and found that rumors propagate more slowly in BBV networks than in unweighted networks. The numerical simulation results also demonstrated that as the forgetting rate increases, the rumor’s influence decreases in both BBV networks and unweighted networks. Finally, the simulation results confirmed that a threshold exists for rumor propagation in BBV networks, but that it was independent of the value of the stifling rate.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a sentiment analysis of the Twitter discussion on the 2016 Austrian presidential elections. In particular, we extracted and analyzed a data-set consisting of 343645 Twitter messages related to the 2016 Austrian presidential elections. Our analysis combines methods from network science and sentiment analysis. Among other things, we found that: a) the winner of the election (Alexander Van der Bellen) predominantly sent tweets resulting in neutral sentiment scores, while his opponent (Norbert Hofer) preferred emotional messages (i.e. tweets resulting in positive or negative sentiment scores), b) negative information about both candidates continued spreading for a longer time compared to neutral and positive information, c) there was a clear polarization in terms of the sentiments spread by Twitter followers of the two presidential candidates, d) the winner of the election received considerably more likes and retweets, while his opponent received more replies, e) the Twitter followers of the winner substantially participated in the spread of misinformation about him.

Abstract: Identifying highly susceptible individuals in spreading processes is of great significance in controlling outbreaks. In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of people in susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and rumor spreading dynamics. We first study the impact of community structure on people’s susceptibility. Although the community structure can reduce the number of infected people for same infection rate, it will not significantly affect nodes’ susceptibility. We find the susceptibility of individuals is sensitive to the choice of spreading dynamics. For SIR spreading, since the susceptibility is highly correlated to nodes’ influence, the topological indicator k-shell can better identify highly susceptible individuals, outperforming degree, betweenness centrality and PageRank. In contrast, in rumor spreading model, where nodes’ susceptibility and influence have no clear correlation, degree performs the best among considered topological measures. Our finding highlights the significance of both topological features and spreading mechanisms in identifying highly susceptible population.

Abstract: Currently cyber-security has attracted a lot of attention, in particular in wireless industrial control networks (WICNs). In this paper, the stability of wireless networked control systems (WNCSs) under deception attacks is studied with a token-based protocol applied to the data link layer (DLL) of WICNS. Since deception attacks cause the stability problem of WNCSs by changing the data transmitted over wireless network, it is important to detect deception attacks, discard the injected false data and compensate for the missing data (i.e., the discarded original data with the injected false data). The main contributions of this paper are: 1) With respect to the character of the token-based protocol, a switched system model is developed. Different from the traditional switched system where the number of subsystems is fixed, in our new model this number will be changed under deception attacks. 2) For this model, a new Kalman filter (KF) is developed for the purpose of attack detection and the missing data reconstruction. 3) For the given linear feedback WNCSs, when the noise level is below a threshold derived in this paper, the maximum allowable duration of deception attacks is obtained to maintain the exponential stability of the system. Finally, a numerical example based on a linearized model of an inverted pendulum is provided to demonstrate the proposed design.

Abstract: Social media has developed extremely fast in metropolises in recent years resulting in more and more rumors disturbing our daily lives. Knowing the characteristics of rumor propagation in metropolises can help the government make efficient rumor refutation plans. In this paper, we established a dynamic spatio-temporal comprehensive risk assessment model for rumor propagation based on an improved 8-state ICSAR model (Ignorant, Information Carrier, Information Spreader, Advocate, Removal), large personal activity trajectory data, and governmental rumor refutation (anti-rumor) scenarios. Combining these relevant data with the ‘big’ traffic data on the use of subways, buses, and taxis, we simulated daily oral communications among inhabitants in Beijing. In order to analyze rumor and anti-rumor competition in the actual social network, personal resistance, personal preference, conformity, rumor intensity, government rumor refutation and other influencing factors were considered. Based on the developed risk assessment model, a long-term dynamic rumor propagation simulation for a seven day period was conducted and a comprehensive rumor propagation risk distribution map was obtained. A set of the sensitivity analyses were conducted for different social media and propagation routes. We assessed different anti-rumor coverage ratios and the rumor-spreading thresholds at which the government started to launch anti-rumor actions. The results we obtained provide worthwhile references useful for governmental decision making towards control of social-disrupting rumors.

Abstract: We study rumor propagation process with incubation and constant immigration. We take into account a deterministic rumor spreading model and demonstrate the persistence of a rumor when the basic reproduction number is greater than one. Due to the presence of a randomness in the influence that the incubators exert on ignorants, we extrapolate the deterministic rumor model to a stochastic one by using a stochastic coefficient for the term representing the latter influence within the system. The existence and boundedness of both local and global solutions are demonstrated. We prove the uniqueness of these solutions. Conditions of extinction is also established. We perform numerical simulations to verify our stochastic model. The present work can assist decision takers in the analysis of the dynamical evolution of rumors in a given society as well as in the study of information dissemination strategies.

Abstract: Reaction time–based measures of deception and concealed information are becoming increasingly popular. Laboratory research has shown that lying and information concealment take reliably longer than simple truth-telling. Although the use of some reaction time paradigms is restricted to theoretical research so far, other paradigms show promise to be used in applied settings (e.g., the Reaction Time Concealed Information Test and the autobiographical Implicit Association Test). The current chapter summarizes previous research regarding the validity of reaction time–based deception and concealed information measures and their vulnerability to faking. It also discusses limitations of previous research and identifies open questions that should be addressed in the future.

Abstract: To maximize the spreading influence of multiple spreaders in complex networks, one important fact cannot be ignored: the multiple spreaders should be dispersively distributed in networks, which can effectively reduce the redundance of information spreading. For this purpose, we define a generalized closeness centrality (GCC) index by generalizing the closeness centrality index to a set of nodes. The problem converts to how to identify multiple spreaders such that an objective function has the minimal value. By comparing with the K-means clustering algorithm, we find that the optimization problem is very similar to the problem of minimizing the objective function in the K-means method. Therefore, how to find multiple nodes with the highest GCC value can be approximately solved by the K-means method. Two typical transmission dynamics—epidemic spreading process and rumor spreading process are implemented in real networks to verify the good performance of our proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamic model of malware propagation in scale-free networks (SFNs) based on a rumor spreading model. The proposed model, which is called the susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered–susceptible with a vaccination state (SEIRS-V) model, illustrates the dynamics of malware propagation with respect to time in SFNs. The model considers the impact of software diversity to halt the outbreak of malware in networks. Using the SEIRS-V model, we derive the basic reproductive ratio that governs whether or not a malware is extinct. Furthermore, we calculate the number of diverse software packages installed on computer nodes that can be introduced as a parameter to prevent malware spreading. We accomplish the systematic analysis of the model and represent the local and global stability of malware-free equilibrium. Using numerical simulations, we examine the theoretical analysis. The effects of diversification and vaccination on the model are investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the model is more effective than other existing models of malware propagation, in terms of reducing the density of infected node.

Abstract: There are significant differences between rumor spreading and epidemic spreading in social networks, especially with consideration of the mutual effect of forgetting and remembering mechanisms. In this paper, a new rumor spreading model, Susceptible-Infected-Hibernator-Removed (SIHR) model, is developed. The model extends the classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) rumor spreading model by adding a direct link from ignorants to stiflers and a new kind of people-Hibernators. We derive mean-field equations that describe the dynamics of the SIHR model in social networks. Then a steady-state analysis is conducted to investigate the final size of the rumor spreading under various spreading rate, stifling rate, forgetting rate, and average degree of the network. We discuss the spreading threshold and find the relationship between the final size of the rumor and two probabilities. Also Runge–Kutta method is used for numerical simulation which shows that the direct link from the ignorants to the stiflers advances the rumor terminal time and reduces the maximum rumor influence. Moreover, the forgetting and remembering mechanisms of hibernators postpone the rumor terminal time and reduce the maximum rumor influence.

Abstract: Rumor propagation as a typical form of social communication in online social networks has had a significant negative impact on a harmonious and stable society. With the rapid development of mobile communication equipments, traditional rumor propagation models, which depend on ordinary differential equations (ODE), may not be suitable for describing rumor propagation in an online social network. In this paper, based on reaction-diffusion equations, we propose a novel epidemic-like model with both discrete and nonlocal delays for investigating the spatial-temporal dynamics of rumor propagation. By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations of this model, the local stability conditions of a boundary equilibrium point and a positive equilibrium point are established. By applying the linear approximation method of nonlinear systems, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of Hopf bifurcation at the above two kinds of equilibrium points. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis method based on the density of spreading users is proposed, and then in theoretical and experimental aspect we identify some sensitive parameters in the process of rumor propagation. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical results.

Phenotypic Plasticity Confers Multiple Fitness Benefits to a Mimic,

Abstract: Summary
Animal communication is often deceptive; however, such dishonesty can become ineffective if it is used too often, is used out of context, or is too easy to detect [1–3]. Mimicry is a common form of deception, and most mimics gain the greatest fitness benefits when they are rare compared to their models [3, 4]. If mimics are encountered too frequently or if their model is absent, avoidance learning of noxious models is disrupted (Batesian mimicry [3]), or receivers become more vigilant and learn to avoid perilous mimics (aggressive mimicry [4]). Mimics can moderate this selective constraint by imperfectly resembling multiple models [5], through polymorphisms [6], or by opportunistically deploying mimetic signals [1, 7]. Here we uncover a novel mechanism to escape the constraints of deceptive signaling: phenotypic plasticity allows mimics to deceive targets using multiple guises. Using a combination of behavioral, cell histological, and molecular methods, we show that a coral reef fish, the dusky dottyback (Pseudochromis fuscus), flexibly adapts its body coloration to mimic differently colored reef fishes and in doing so gains multiple fitness benefits. We find that by matching the color of other reef fish, dottybacks increase their success of predation upon juvenile fish prey and are therefore able to deceive their victims by resembling multiple models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that changing color also increases habitat-associated crypsis that decreases the risk of being detected by predators. Hence, when mimics and models share common selective pressures, flexible imitation of models might inherently confer secondary benefits to mimics. Our results show that phenotypic plasticity can act as a mechanism to ease constraints that are typically associated with deception.

Abstract: A study was conducted to investigate the body movements of participants waiting to be interviewed in one of two conditions: preparing to answer questions truthfully or preparing to lie. The effects of increased self-awareness were also investigated, with half of the participants facing a mirror; the other half facing a blank wall. Analysis of covertly obtained video footage showed a significant interaction for the duration of hand/arm movements between deception level and self-awareness. Without a mirror, participants expecting to lie spent less time moving their hands than those expecting to tell the truth; the opposite was seen in the presence of a mirror. Participants expecting to lie also had higher levels of anxiety and thought that they were left waiting for less time than those expecting to tell the truth. These findings led to the identification of further research areas with the potential to support deception detection in security applications.

Abstract: Doerr and Fouz [Asymptotically optimal randomized rumor spreading, in: Proceedings of the 38th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP), 2011, pp. 502–513] presented a new quasi-random PUSH algorithm for the rumor spreading problem on complete graphs. Their protocol is the first randomized PUSH protocol with an asymptotically optimal running time. This is achieved by equipping all nodes with the same lists, and by allowing them to do a random restart after encountering an already informed node. Here in this work, we show that the same running time can be achieved if every second random restart is replaced by a reversion of the direction in which the nodes follow their lists. Put differently, our direction-reversing quasi-random rumor spreading protocol with random restarts achieves the same running time as the hybrid model by employing only (roughly) half the number of random choices.

Abstract: This paper treats two types of competitive facility location games on graphs: information diffusion games and discrete Voronoi games. Both of these games can be regarded as models of the rumor spreading processes on the networks, where each player of the game wants to select an influencer who can widely spread information throughout the network. For each game, given a graph and the number of players, we are interested in whether there exist pure Nash equilibria or not. In this paper, we discuss the existence of pure Nash equilibria on graphs with small diameter, path graphs, and cycle graphs. The results include the behavior of the discrete Voronoi games on graphs with diameter two, and the complete characterization of the existence of the pure Nash equilibria in the discrete Voronoi games and information diffusion games on path graphs.

Abstract: With the development of social networks, the impact of rumor propagation on human lives is more and more significant. Due to the change of propagation mode, traditional rumor propagation models designed for word-of-mouth process may not be suitable for describing the rumor spreading on social networks. To overcome this shortcoming, we carefully analyze the mechanisms of rumor propagation and the topological properties of large-scale social networks, then propose a novel model based on the physical theory. In this model, heat energy calculation formula and Metropolis rule are introduced to formalize this problem and the amount of heat energy is used to measure a rumor’s impact on a network. Finally, we conduct track experiments to show the evolution of rumor propagation, make comparison experiments to contrast the proposed model with the traditional models, and perform simulation experiments to study the dynamics of rumor spreading. The experiments show that (1) the rumor propagation simulated by our model goes through three stages: rapid growth, fluctuant persistence and slow decline; (2) individuals could spread a rumor repeatedly, which leads to the rumor’s resurgence; (3) rumor propagation is greatly influenced by a rumor’s attraction, the initial rumormonger and the sending probability.

Abstract: Anti-rumor dynamics is proposed on the basis of rumor dynamics and the characteristics of anti-rumor dynamics are explored by both mean-field equations and numerical simulations on complex network. The main metrics we study are the timing effect of combating rumor and the identification of influential nodes, which are what an efficient strategy against rumor may concern about. The results indicate that, there exists robust time dependence of anti-rumor dynamics and the timing threshold emerges as a consequence of launching the anti-rumor at different delay time after the beginning of rumor spreading. The timing threshold as a critical feature is further verified on a series of Barabási–Albert scale-free networks (BA networks), where anti-rumor dynamics arises explicitly. The timing threshold is a network-dependent quantity and its value decreases as the average degree of the BA network increases until close to zero. Meanwhile, coreness also constitutes a better topological descriptor to identify hubs. Our results will hopefully be useful for the understanding of spreading behaviors of rumor and anti-rumor and suggest a possible avenue for further study of interplays of multiple pieces of information on complex network.

Abstract: Identifying the influential spreaders in complex network is a very important topic, which is conducive to deeply understanding the role of nodes in the information diffusion and epidemic spreading among a population. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel classified neighbors algorithm to quantify the nodal spreading capability and further to differentiate the influence of various nodes. Here, we believe that the contribution of different neighbors to their focal node is different, and then classify the neighbors of the focal node according to the removal order of the neighbor in the process of k-shell decomposition. By assigning different weights for each class of neighbors and summing up the neighbors’ contributions, the spreading capacity of the focal node can be accurately characterized. Through extensive simulation experiments over 9 real-world networks, the weight distribution of different types of neighbors has been optimized, and the results strongly indicate that the current algorithm has the higher ranking accuracy and differentiation extent when compared to other algorithms, such as degree centrality, k-shell decomposition method and mixed degree decomposition approach. Current results can help to greatly reduce the cost of sales promotion, considerably suppress the rumor dissemination and effectively control the outbreak of epidemics within many real-world systems.

Abstract: Rumor spreading influences how rational individuals assess risks and evaluate needs, especially, it affects authorities to make decisions in an emergency-affected environments. Conversely, authorities’ response to emergency will induct public opinions as well. In this paper, we present a simple model to describe the interplay between rumor spreading and authorities’ actions in emergency situation based on utility theory. By drawing from differential equations we found that it is possible to minimize negative social utility of rumor spreading in the control of situation. At the same time, authorities’ proactive actions can improve rumor management in emergency situation and yield positive social utility. Finally, we outline strategies for authorities that can contribute to rumor management in an emergency event.

Abstract: What role should scientist play in correcting bad science, fake science, and pseudoscience presented in popular media? Here, we present a case study based on fake documentaries and discuss effective social media strategies for scientists who want to engage with the public on issues of bad science, pseudoscience, and fake science. We identify two tracks that scientists can use to maximize the broad dissemination of corrective and educational content: that of an audience builder or an expert resource. Finally, we suggests that scientists familiarize themselves with common sources of misinformation within their field, so that they can be better able to respond quickly when factually inaccurate content begins to spread.

Abstract: We study deception choices, the self-selection of capable and less capable deceivers and deception detection in a tax compliance experiment. We find large systematic differences between whether subjects are perceived as honest or as dishonest. Taxpayers are seemingly aware of these perceptions. The empirical outcomes are in line with a theory suggesting that taxpayers make their tax compliance choices on the basis of these perceptions. Taxpayers who are perceived as honest self-select since they are more likely to underreport. This selection effect is stronger if the fines for underreporting are high.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the attack scheduling of deception attacks for discrete-time systems with attack detection. Specifically, for a class of Kalman filters with χ2 detectors, an attacker with the given attack task needs to decide how many the maximum number is or how much the attack probability is for different kinds of attack scenarios (i.e. consecutive deception attacks or randomly launched deception attacks). Firstly, in light of the property of χ2 distribution, the predictions of detection probabilities under attacks are calculated in mean-square sense for these two attack scenarios. Then, in terms of predicted probabilities, the deception attack schemes are designed in the framework of Kalman filtering. For the case of consecutive attacks, the maximum number of attacks is determined via recursive Riccati-like difference equations. For the case of randomly launched deception attacks, the desired attack probability is obtained by solving a Riccati-like equation. Finally, a numerical example on target tracking is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed suboptimal attack schemes.

Abstract: There is an increasing demand for deception detection at scale. In situations in which larger numbers of people need to be tested, traditional deception-detection methods are limited because they often require extensive testing sessions or are limited in their flexibility to novel contexts. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the potential for large-scale applications of several deception-detection methods. Specifically, we evaluate the theoretical foundations of the methods, the potential for quick data-collection procedures, and the flexibility of implementing the methods in different contexts. Each method (behavioral observation, reaction times, speech analysis, verbal content, thermal imaging) is outlined, evaluated, and discussed on the suitability for large-scale purposes. There is no substantial evidence to support the validity of behavioral observation nor of speech analysis. Reaction times and verbal content analysis are promising for future of large-scale applications. To reach their full potential, for both methods the key challenges are a fast data-collection process (e.g., remote online testing) and a near real-time assessment of the data. We close this chapter with an outlook on possible new applications including the integration of methods (i.e., multimodal approaches).

Abstract: This experiment tests how people produce and detect deception while playing a computerized version of the dice game, Meyer. Deception is an integral part of this game, and the participants played it as in real life, without constraints on whether or when to attempt to deceive their opponent, and whether or when to accuse them of deception. We stress that deception is a complex act that cannot be exclusively associated with telling a falsehood, and that it is facilitated by hierarchical decision-making and risk evaluation. In comparison with a non-competitive control condition, both claiming truthfully and claiming falsely were associated with activity in fronto-polar cortex (BA10). However, relative to true claims, false claims were associated with greater activity in the premotor and parietal cortices. We speculate that the activity in BA10 is associated with the development of high-level executive strategies involved in both types of claim, while the premotor and parietal activity is associated with the need to select which particular claim to make.

Abstract: It was been hypothesized that evolutionary factors including self-awareness and commitment are related to deception detection. In this study, 34 female undergraduates were tested for their ability to detect deception via a video paradigm. Females that were not in a committed relationship were significantly better at detecting males “faking good” as compared to committed females. Further, self-awareness was correlated with the ability to detect deception. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that deception may be related to self-awareness and that such a relationship is related to reproductive advantages secured by the ability to deceive.
